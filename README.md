# hello-world
My first repository saying hello to the world
Constant pursuit of self-edification through challenge and achievement.
I'm a Mechanical/Aerospace Engineer looking to get into self-driving cars.
I am always interested in the new and developing. I hope to contribute something
useful to the world and affect billions of people.
